The "Saiman Says" Game is a fun and interactive web-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a digital version of the classic memory game "Simon Says," where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors or sounds in the correct order.
How It Works:
1.Game Start: When the game begins, the system highlights a button in a specific color and plays its associated sound.

2.User Input: The player must click the buttons in the same order that the system displayed them.

3.Progressive Difficulty: With each correct sequence, the game adds another step to the sequence, increasing the challenge.

4.Game Over: If the player clicks the wrong button or fails to remember the sequence, the game ends, and the player is given the option to restart.
